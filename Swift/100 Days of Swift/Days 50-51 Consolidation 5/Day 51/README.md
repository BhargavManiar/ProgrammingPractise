# Day 51

## Description
This is a check mark for the first 50 days. Day 51 does not invlove any programming but rather watching two talks that Paul has done.

While you’re just learning it’s easy to miss just how interesting our community is, so today I would you like you to watch two talks I’ve given at conferences last year: dotSwift in Paris and NSSpain in Logroño.

I’ve picked out these talks for different reasons:

* At this point in your learning, the dotSwift talk will be totally within your grasp, but will still inspire you to write better Swift code.

* The NSSpain talk will about 70% in your grasp, and about 30% new, but I think at this point you’ll appreciate some of the many pain points I talk about.
