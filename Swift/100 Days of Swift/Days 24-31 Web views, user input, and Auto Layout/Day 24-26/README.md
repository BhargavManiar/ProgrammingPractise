## Project 3 Challenges 

1. If users try visit a URL that isn't allowed, show an alert saying it's blocked.

2. Try making two new toolbar items with the titles Back and Forward. You should make them use webView.goBack and webView.goForward.

3. For more of a challenge, try changin the initial view controller to a table view like in project 1, where users can choose their
website from a list rather than having the first in the array loaded up front. 

Tip
Once you have completed project 5, you might like to return here to add in the option to load the list of websites from a file, 
rather than having them hard-coded in an array.
