# Let and Const

## Objective
In this challenge, we practice declaring variables using the let and const keywords. Check out the attached tutorial for more details.

## Task
1. Declare a constant variable, ***PI***, and assign it the value Math.PI. You will not pass this challenge unless the variable is declared as a constant and named `PI` (uppercase).
2. Read a number, ***r***, denoting the radius of a circle from stdin.
3. Use  ***PI*** and ***r*** to calculate the ***area*** and ***perimeter*** of a circle having radius ***r***.
4. Print ***area*** as the first line of output and print  ***perimeter*** as the second line of output.

## Input Format
A single integer, ***r***, denoting the radius of a circle.

## Constraints
* **0** <= **100**
* ***r*** is a floating-point number scaled to at most **3** decimal places.

## Output Format
Print the following two lines:

1. On the first line, print the ***area*** of the circle having radius ***r***.
2. On the second line, print the  ***perimeter*** of the circle having radius ***r***. 

## Sample Input 0
> 2.6

## Sample Output 0
> 21.237166338267002
>
> 16.336281798666924

## Explanation 0
Given the radius ***r*** = **2.6**, we calculate the following:

* ***area*** = ***π*** · ***r<sup>2</sup>*** = **21.237166338267002**

* ***perimeter*** = **2** · ***π*** · ***r*** = **16.336281798666924**

We then print ***area*** as our first line of output and ***perimeter*** as our second line of output.
