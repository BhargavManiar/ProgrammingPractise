A Linear Equation can be represented in matrix form using a:

Coefficient Matrix
Variable Matrix and
Constant Matrix
The System of linear equation in three variables,

a1x+b1y+c1z=d1
a2x+b2y+c2z=d2
a3x+b3y+c3z=d3
The Matrix Representation would be

a1 b1 c1       xd1
a2 b2 c2y      =d2
a3 b3 c3 zd3
We generalize the result of n variable

a1 b1 c1             
a2 b2 c2     __     Coefficient Matrix
a3 b3 c3
x,y,z  are Variable Matrix
d1,d2,d3 are Constant Matrix
Consider the System,

x+2y+3z=4
5x+6y+7z=8
8x+7y+6z=5
Then, the coefficient matrix for the above system is

1 2 3 
5 6 7 
8 7 6
Variable Matrix are X, Y, Z

Constant Matrix are 4,8,5

Representing of linear Matrix in above System is:

1 2 3 x     4
5 6 7 y     = 8
8 7 6 z     5
