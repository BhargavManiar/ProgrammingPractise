Here we are going to use bitwise operators to isolate rightmost zero bit in the binary representation of a given number.

Problem Statement: To write a C++ program to isolate rightmost zero bit of a number.

Constraints: 1<=n<=100

Example:

    Input:
    Enter number: 11

    Output:    
    original number before isolating rightmost 0 bit: 11
    new number after isolating rightmost 0 bit: 4
