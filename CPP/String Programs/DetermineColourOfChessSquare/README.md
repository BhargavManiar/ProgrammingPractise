A chess board is equally divided into 64 identical squares that are black and white alternately. Each square on the chessboard can be identified by the coordinates as 'A' to 'H' on the horizontal axis and '1' to '8' on the vertical axis as shown in the figure.


Each square can be identified using the coordinate system specified above. For example, the square with coordinates G5 is colored Black, A6 is colored White and so on...

A program to identify the color of a specified square is given below.
