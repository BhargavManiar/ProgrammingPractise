# Create a Button

## Objective

In this challenge, we practice creating buttons in JavaScript. Check out the attached tutorial for learning materials.

## Task

Complete the code in the editor so that it creates a clickable button satisfying the following properties:

* The button's `id` is `btn`.
* The button's initial text label is **0**. After each click, the button must increment by **1**. Recall that the button's text label is the JS object's `innerHTML` property.
* The button has the following style properties:
    * A `width` of `96px`.
    * A `height` of `48px`.
    * The `font-size` attribute is `24px`.

The `.js` and `.css` files are in different directories, so use the *link* tag to provide the CSS file path and the *script* tag to provide the JS file path:

```<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
    <head>
        <link rel="stylesheet" href="css/button.css" type="text/css">
    </head>
    
    <body>
        <script src="js/button.js" type="text/javascript"></script>
    </body>
</html>
```

## Submissions

This is a new style of challenge involving Front-End rendering. It may take up to **10** seconds to see the result of your code, so please be *patient after clicking* ***Submit***. The Submissions page contains screenshots to help you gauge how well you did.
