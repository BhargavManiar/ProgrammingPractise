# Operators

## Objective 
In this challenge, you will work with arithmetic operators. Check out the [Tutorial](https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/30-operators/tutorial) tab for learning materials and an instructional video.

## Task 
Given the meal price (base cost of a meal), tip percent (the percentage of the meal price being added as tip), and tax percent (the percentage of the meal price being added as tax) for a meal, find and print the meal's total cost. Round the result to the nearest integer.

## Example 
 
 ***meal<sub>c</sub>ost  = 100***
 
 ***tip<sub>p</sub>ercent = 15***
 
 ***tax<sub>p</sub>ercent = 8***
 
A tip of 15% * 100 = 15, and the taxes are 8% * 100 = 8. Print the value  **123** and return from the function.

## Function Description 
Complete the solve function in the editor below.

solve has the following parameters:

* int meal_cost: the cost of food before tip and tax

* int tip_percent: the tip percentage

* int tax_percent: the tax percentage

Returns The function returns nothing. Print the calculated value, rounded to the nearest integer.

**Note:** Be sure to use precise values for your calculations, or you may end up with an incorrectly rounded result.

## Input Format
There are **3** lines of numeric input: 
The first line has a double, ***meal<sub>c</sub>ost*** (the cost of the meal before tax and tip). 
The second line has an integer, ***tip<sub>p</sub>ercent*** (the percentage of  ***mealCost*** being added as tip). 
The third line has an integer, ***tax<sub>p</sub>ercent*** (the percentage of ***mealCost***  being added as tax).

## Sample Input
> 12.00
> 
> 20
> 
> 8

## Sample Output
> 15

## Explanation

Given:

***meal_cost*** = **12**, ***tip_percent*** = **20** , ***tax_percent*** = **8** 

Calculations:

***tip*** = **12 and  12/100 x 20 = 2.4**

***tax*** = **8 and 8/100 x 20 = 0.96**

***total_cost*** = ***meal_cost*** + ***tip*** + ***tax*** = **12** + **2.4** + **0.96** = **15.36**

***round(total_cost)*** = **15**
 
We round  ***total_cost*** to the nearest integer and print the result, **15**.
