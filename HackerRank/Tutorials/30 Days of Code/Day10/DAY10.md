# Binary Numbers

## Objective 
Today, we're working with binary numbers. Check out the [Tutorial](https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/30-binary-numbers/tutorial) tab for learning materials and an instructional video!

## Task 
Given a base-**10** integer, ***n***, convert it to binary (base-**2**). Then find and print the base-**10** integer denoting the maximum number of consecutive **1**'s in ***n***'s binary representation. When working with different bases, it is common to show the base as a subscript.

## Example 
***n*** = **125**

The binary representation of **125<sub>10</sub>** is **1111101<sub>2</sub>**. In base **10**, there are **5** and **1** consecutive ones in two groups. Print the maximum, **5**.

## Input Format
A single integer, ***n***.

## Constraints
* **1** <= ***n*** <= **10<sup>6</sup>**

## Output Format
Print a single base-**10** integer that denotes the maximum number of consecutive **1**'s in the binary representation of ***n***.

## Sample Input 1
> 5

## Sample Output 1
> 1

## Sample Input 2
> 13

## Sample Output 2
> 2

## Explanation

Sample Case 1: 

The binary representation of **5<sub>10<sub>** is **101<sub>2</sub>**, so the maximum number of consecutive **1**'s is **1**.

Sample Case 2:

The binary representation of  **13<sub>10</sub>** is **1101<sub>2</sub>**, so the maximum number of consecutive **1**'s is **2**.
