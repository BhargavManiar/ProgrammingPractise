#Pair Case: C++ program to enter '*' between two identical characters in a string

Here, we are going to implement a C++ program that will enter asterisk (*) between two identical characters in a string.

Submitted by Indrajeet Das, on December 14, 2018

Given a string, compute recursively a new string where identical chars that are adjacent in the original string are separated from each other by a "*".

Sample Input 1: "hello"

Sample Output 1: "hel*lo"

Sample Input 2: "xxyy"

Sample Output 2: "x*xy*y"

Sample Input 3: "aaaa"

Sample Output 3: "a*a*a*a"
