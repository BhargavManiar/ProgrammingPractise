## Project 8 Challenges 

1. Modify project 1 so that loading the list of NSSL images from our bundle happens in the background.
Make sure you call reloadData() on the table view once loading has finished!

2. Modify project 8 so that loading and parsing a level takes place in the background.
Once you’re done, make sure you update the UI on the main thread!

3 .Modify project 7 so that your filtering code takes place in the background.
This filtering code was added in one of the challenges for the project, so hopefully you didn’t skip it!
