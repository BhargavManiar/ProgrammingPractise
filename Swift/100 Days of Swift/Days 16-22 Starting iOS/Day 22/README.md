## Project 3 Challenges
1. Try adding the image name to the list of items that are shared. The activityItems parameter is an array, so you can add strings and other things freely. Note: Facebook wonâ€™t let you share text, but most other share options will.

2. Go back to project 1 and add a bar button item to the main view controller that recommends the app to other people.

3. Go back to project 2 and add a bar button item that shows their score when tapped.
