# Data Types

## Objective
Today, we're discussing data types. Check out the attached tutorial for more details.

## Task
Variables named ***firstInteger***, ***firstDecimal***, and ***firstString***  are declared for you in the editor below. You must use the + operator to perform the following sequence of operations:

1. Convert  ***secondInteger*** to an integer (Number type), then sum it with ***firstInteger*** and print the result on a new line using `console.log`.
2. Convert  ***secondDecimal*** to a floating-point number (Number type), then sum it with  ***firstInteger*** and print the result on a new line using `console.log`.
3. Print the concatenation of ***firstString*** and ***secondString*** on a new line using `console.log`. Note that  ***firstString*** must be printed first.

## Input Format 

| Data Type | Parameter | Description |
|:-----------:|:------------:|:--------------:|
| string        | ***secondInteger*** | The string representation of an integer you must sum with ***firstInteger***. |
| string        |  ***secondDecimal*** | The string representation of a floating-point number you must sum with ***firstDecimal***. |
| string        | ***secondString*** | The string of one or more space-separated words you must append to ***secondString***. |

## Output Format
Print the following three lines of output:
1. On the first line, print the sum of ***firstInteger***  and the integer representation of ***secondInteger***.
2. On the second line, print the sum of  ***firstDecimal*** and the floating-point representation of ***secondDecimal***.
3. On the third line, print ***firstString*** concatenated with ***secondString***. You must print  ***firstString*** before ***secondString***.

## Sample Input 0
>12
>
>4.32
>
>is the best place to learn and practice coding!

## Sample Output 0
>16
>
>8.32
>
>HackerRank is the best place to learn and practice coding!

## Explanation 0
When we sum the integers  **4** and **12**, we get the integer **16**. 
When we sum the floating-point numbers  **4.0** and **4.32**, we get **8.32**. When we concatenate `HackerRank with is the best place to learn and practice coding!**, we get **HackerRank is the best place to learn and practice coding!`.

**You will not pass this challenge if you attempt to assign the Sample Case values to your variables instead of following the instructions above.**
