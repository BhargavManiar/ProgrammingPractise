// Overloading just means an operator depends on the values it is used with

// Example with integers
let meaningOfLife = 42
let doubleMeaning = 42 + 42

// Example with strings
let fakers = "Fakers gonna "
let action = fakers + "fake"

// Example with arrays
let firstHalf = ["John", "Paul"]
let secondHalf = ["George", "Ringo"]
let beatles = firstHalf + secondHalf
