## Project 1 Challenges

1. User Interface Builder to select the text label inside your table view cell and adjust its size to something larger.

2. In your main table view, show the image names in sorted order so ‘nssl0033.jpg’ comes before ‘nssl0034.jpg’

3. Rather than show image names in the details title bar show ‘Picture x of y’, where y is the total number of images and x is the picture’s position in the array. 

Project 3 Challenge 2 requires editing this app.
