# Overview: 10 Days of JavaScript
This series focuses on learning and practicing JavaScript. Each challenge comes with a tutorial article, and you can view these articles by clicking either the Topics tab along the top or the article icon in the right-hand menu.

## Objective
In this challenge, we review some basic concepts that will get you started with this series. Check out the tutorial to learn more about JavaScript's lexical structure.

## Task
A greeting function is provided for you in the editor below. It has one parameter, ***parameterVariable***. Perform the following tasks to complete this challenge:

1. Use console.log() to print `Hello, World!` on a new line in the console, which is also known as stdout or standard output. The code for this portion of the task is already provided in the editor.
2. Use console.log() to print the contents of ***parameterVariable***  (i.e., the argument passed to main).

You've got this!

## Explanation 0
We printed two lines of output:
1. We printed the literal string `Hello, World!` using the code provided in the editor.
2. The value of  ***parameterVariable*** passed to our main function in this Sample Case was `Welcome to 10 Days of JavaScript!`. We then passed our variable to console.log, which printed the contents of ***parameterVariable***.
